# Installing
Currently there is no official way of installing the project, for now we have included an app that will **"register"** the app for **test purposes only**, the file is called **test_register.exe**, you need to run it as **Administrator** in order for the registration to succeed.

Once the installer is opened, you can either choose to **Install** to try it, or **Uninstall** when you're done using the app.
> Please **uninstall** once you're done using the app, otherwise you won't be able to delete the file while it is registered.
# Usage
## Enabling/Disabling
Before you continue, make sure the keyboard is active, to change your current keyboard type, click the **ENG** button at the bottom right corner (If you use English as a default keyboard), and select the item that has **Lannang-ue Keyboard** in it.

You can toggle it by clicking the ON/OFF icon beside the keyboard icon, or by pressing **Shift** once every toggle.
